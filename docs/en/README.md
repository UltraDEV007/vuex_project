## What is Vuex?

A state management library.

And an application architecture for Vue.js.

## Principles

- Terse
- Testable
- Reactive
- Single State Tree
- Hot Reloading
- Time Travel

## Difference from Redux/Flux

- Simplified concepts.

- Specifically built for Vue.js, therefore reactive by default. Super simple for components to bind to state.

- Doesn't enforce immutability, but retains the same benefits of hot reloading and time travel debugging.
